    2. **System** - Select the target system.
    3. **Create a default tile map** - When this is selected we'll automatically create a tile map for you, normally
       you would want this option to be selected, however, if you intend to work with raw tiles and don't need a tile map
       you can select this option.
    4. **Size preset** - Choose a size for the tile map, or you may enter a custom size. 
    5. **Width** and **Height** - When using a custom size, you may customise the width and height.
4. When you're done click the [**Create project**] button to create the project.
