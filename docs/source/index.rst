What is SMSGFX?
---------------
SMSGFX is tile editor to help you make graphics for retro games.

It runs entirely within your web browser and doesn't require any software
downloads or online cloud accounts to operate.

Using the available tools you can paint up your own tile based graphics, 
define colour palettes and arrange them in tile maps. When you're done you can 
export your work into a format that the your target console understands 
for use in your projects.

If you have an existing game project, or graphics as image files then you can 
also easily bring those graphics into SMSGFX, work with them and then export 
them again for use in your project. 

Projects are automatically saved as you work within your local web browser, with
support for multiple projects that can be worked on concurrently in different 
browser tabs or windows.
