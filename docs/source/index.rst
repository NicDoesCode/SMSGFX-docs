What is SMSGFX?
---------------
SMSGFX is a browser based tile editor that allows you to make graphics for 
Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear.

You can import graphics from image files, the clipboard, assembly code or 
simply draw something from scratch, and when you're done you can export the 
graphics in a format that the Sega Master System and Game Gear understands.

Projects are automatically saved in your browser as you work, you can load 
and save projects from files.
